The value of the aforesaid products was\\ndetermined in accordance with the underlying basket of instruments. The content of the\\nunderlying basket was determined by the \\u201cindex sponsor\\u201d. According to the terms and\\nconditions governed the specific products the underlying basket was (theoretically) virtual\\nand therefore no actual investment into the underlying was supposed to take place.\\nMarfin Egnatia Bank S.A (a subsidiary of CPB) was initially appointed as the index sponsor.\\nHowever, as a consequence of the results of the cross-border merger between Marfin\\nEgnatia Bank S.A. and the CPB, the CPB became the index sponsor as of 31 March 2011.\\nThe initial investment into the structured products took place on 5 February 2008.\\nHowever, the composition of the underlying basket was dynamic and was determined by\\nthe Index Sponsor. The underlying basket was mainly comprised of shares of the CPB and\\nother firms of the Marfin Investment Group (to which the CPB belonged). The CPB shares\\nwere incorporated into the underlying basket of the Structured Product with ISIN\\nXS0345364227, in 2011.\\nBased on the evidence made available to CySEC, Commerzbank AG executed the voting\\nrights attached to the shares purchased (including the CPB shares) during the\\nShareholders\\u2019 General Meetings in all cases following a request and based on the\\ninstructions of the Index Sponsor. The proxy persons had a direct relationship with the\\nrelevant entities.\\nThe findings of the investigation were that the CPB and Commerzbank AG used the\\nstructured product with ISIN XS0345364227 as a vehicle in order for Commerzbank AG to\\n2\\nact as a surrogate of CPB in a disguised manner and acting in concert to manipulate the\\nmarket in relation to CPB\\u2019s shares on 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26 and 27 April 2011\\nand 6 and 30 May 2011.\\nThe acquisition of CPB shares took place in a way that ensured the share price fixing at\\ncertain levels in accordance with their daily target. The placing of orders was likely to give\\nmisleading signals in relation to CPB shares, as such orders did not correspond to\\ninvestors\\u2019 interest but to fictitious demand that was covertly created by the issuer of the\\nshares. These transactions undertaken by Commerzbank AG as a surrogate for the CPB\\ncorresponded in many cases to a significant proportion of the total daily volume of\\ntransactions in relation to the CPB shares.\\nCySEC decided to impose a cumulative fine of \\u20ac650.000 to Commerzbank AG in\\nrelation to the aforesaid violations (\\u20ac50.000 for every day of being in violation,\\nthirteen days in total), taking the fact that more than eight years have elapsed since\\nthe time of the violation into consideration as a mitigating factor.\\nIn the case of the CPB, CySEC decided not to impose a fine for the aforesaid violation\\ntaking into account that:\\ni.\\nThe CPB is under resolution pursuant to Law 17(I)/2013 and/or pursuant to\\nthe relevant decrees issued by the Central Bank of Cyprus and is under\\nspecial administration since 2013. The main activity of CPB is the execution of\\nthe resolution measures.\\nii.\\nUnder these special circumstances the imposition of a fine to the CPB would\\nfurther burden the financial position of its depositors, bond holders and\\nshareholders.\\nCySEC would like to express its thanks to the \\u039dational Competent Authority of Germany\\n(Bundesanstalt f\\xfcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht - BaFin), the Hellenic Capital Market\\nCommission and the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom \\u2013 FCA for the\\nvaluable assistance they provided during this investigation.\\nMore details/justification of CySEC\\u2019s decision are/is available in the Greek version of the\\nannouncement.\\nXB/", "Type": "Penalty/Fine", "Researcher": "ajinkya", "Working_Date": null, "Status": "Relevant", "Case_Status": "Final Hearing", "Order_Type": "Fined", "Imposed_Value": 650000, "Settled_Value": null, "Currency": "EUR", "Cause_of_Penalty": "Market Manipulation", "Registered_Unregistered_activity": null, "Entity_Status": "Company", "Company_Name": "Commerzbank AG", "Individual_Name": null, "Industry": "Financial Services", "Third_parties": "Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), Hellenic Capital Market Commission, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)", "Summary_Remarks": null, "Description_Automated": "```json\n{\n  \"Document Status\": \"Relevant\",\n  \"Entity status\": \"Company\",\n  \"Company name\": \"Commerzbank AG\",\n  \"Individual name\": \"None\",\n  \"Industry type\": \"Financial Services\",\n  \"Basic reason for the penalty\": \"Market Manipulation\",\n  \"Order Type\": \"Fined\",\n  \"Case Status\": \"Final Hearing\",\n  \"Imposed Penalty\": \"650000\",\n  \"Settled Value\": \"None\",\n  \"Currency Code\": \"EUR\",\n  \"Third Party\": \"Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), Hellenic Capital Market Commission, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\",\n  \"Summary\": \"The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) has imposed a cumulative fine of \u20ac650,000 on Commerzbank AG for market manipulation in relation to structured bonds.

The ASX Rules were superseded by the ASIC\\xa0Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 on 7 May 2018.\\nCredit Suisse was engaged as a broker to conduct an on-market buy-back of shares on behalf of three clients. The MDP was satisfied that from 6 March 2017 to 8 November 2018, Credit Suisse entered into a number of trades by matching orders on behalf of both its buying and selling clients rather than by the matching of orders on an order book.

The MDP regards the guidance in RG 223 and RG 265 to correctly reflect the law and prevailing market practice. The MDP considered that Credit Suisse had failed to act in accordance with its clients\\u2019 instructions to conduct an on-market buy-back when it had entered the NXXT trades.\\nThe MDP considered Credit Suisse\\u2019s conduct to be careless because its execution desk employees were inadequately trained in relation to on-market buy-backs and were therefore unaware that NXXT Trades were not permitted during an on-market buy-back.

To this end the Commission sought\\\\nexternal legal advice.\\\\n5.\\\\nThe Commission, after considering the legal advice received, commenced administrative\\\\nproceedings by Notices of Hearing dated 20th July 2018 and supplemented by Notices of\\\\nHearing dated 17th September 2018, 5th October 2018 and 25th January 2019.\\\\n6.\\\\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Commission\\\\u2019s Securities Industry (Hearings\\\\nand Settlements) Practice Rules 2008, the first private pre- hearing conference into the\\\\nMatter took place on 30th January 2019, followed by a second one on 22nd July2019.\\\\n7.\\\\nAfter the Commission\\\\u2019s administrative proceedings commenced, the Respondents\\\\nindividually approached the Commission with requests to enter into settlement\\\\ndiscussions.\\\\n8.\\\\nThe Commission eventually settled with all four respondents namely, Hassan Phillip\\\\nRahaman, Imtiaz Rahaman, Subhas Ramkhelawan and Bourse Brokers Limited by three\\\\nseparate settlement agreements each dated 20th December 2019.\\\\n9.\\\\nThe Settlement Agreements were approved by the Board of Commissioners by Orders\\\\ndated 29th January 2020.\\\\n10.\\\\nThe full texts of the Settlement Agreements and the Orders are available on the\\\\nCommission\\\\u2019s website and members of the public are encouraged to read the\\\\ndocuments in their entirety. The links to the documents on the Commission\\\\u2019s  website\\\\nare as follows:\\\\nSettlement Orders - https://www.ttsec.org.tt/legal-framework/?_sft_category=orders\\\\nSettlement Agreements - https://www.ttsec.org.tt/legal-framework/decisionssettlements/\\\\nResponse to the Public Commentary:\\\\n1. It is therefore incorrect to infer that the Commission acted without consulting the DPP\\\\nor considering whether any criminal offences had been committed by the Respondents.\\\\nThe Commission took all reasonable steps in exploring whether the Respondents\\\\u2019\\\\nactions amounted to criminal offences.2. The Commission initiated administrative proceedings after the DPP concluded that there\\\\nwas insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In March 2017 the Minister of\\\\nFinance reported to Parliament on the Commission\\\\u2019s referral of this Matter to the DPP\\\\nas a matter of public record.\\\\n3. The settlement of matters with respect to breaches of securities legislation is a common\\\\ninstance of international best practice, as it is an efficient means of regulating securities\\\\nmarkets. In the year 2019, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\nsettled 23% of the Matters that it opened; the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK\\\\nsettled 55% of the matters opened and the Australian Securities and Investment\\\\nCommission (ASIC) settled 84% of the matters opened.\\\\n4. In most instances, settlement negotiations and agreements take place in circumstances\\\\nwhere eventual legal outcomes are uncertain and/or the resolution process is expected\\\\nto be both lengthy and costly. Settlement allows the regulator control and certainty\\\\nover the outcome and saves the time and resources that would otherwise be expended\\\\nin lengthy proceedings, including appeals to the High Court, Court of Appeal or Privy\\\\nCouncil pursuant to Section 161 of the Securities Act.\\\\n5. The Commission\\\\u2019s ability to impose fines in administrative proceedings is capped at TTD\\\\n$500,000 per contravention as prescribed by Section 156 (1) of the Securities Act.\\\\nFurther the Commission does not have the statutory authority to make an order of\\\\ndisgorgement nor does it have the ability to Order that shares be forfeited.\\\\n6. The Settlements were guided primarily by the public interest which requires the\\\\nCommission to consider, among other factors, the seriousness and nature of the alleged\\\\ncontraventions, the need for a resolution of the Matter which began six years ago, as\\\\nwell as the uncertainty of the outcome of a lengthy and contested hearing.\\\\n7. Further the Commission determined that the Settlements were consistent with its\\\\ninternal policy, which provides that for contraventions where there is no evidence of\\\\nactual harm to investors, settlement amounts of a particular range (below the maximum\\\\namount of TTD 500, 000) should be levied. Actual harm to investors would typically arise\\\\nwhere investors provide proof of financial loss as a result of the contravention.\\\\n8. In conclusion, the Commission acted consistent with the public interest, reasonably and\\\\nproportionately within the parameters of its statutory powers in considering criminal\\\\nliability and in pursuing administrative action against the Respondents.\\\\nDated the 21st day of February 2020\\\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER", "Type": "Penalty/Fine", "Researcher": "ajinkya", "Working_Date": null, "Status": "Relevant", "Case_Status": "Final Hearing", "Order_Type": "Settlement", "Imposed_Value": "Not specified", "Settled_Value": "Not specified", "Currency": "Not specified", "Cause_of_Penalty": "Securities Act Violation", "Registered_Unregistered_activity": null, "Entity_Status": "Individual", "Company_Name": null, "Individual_Name": "Mr. Hassan Phillip Rahaman", "Industry": null, "Third_parties": null, "Summary_Remarks": null, "Description_Automated": "```json\n{\n  \"Document Status\": \"Relevant\",\n  \"Entity status\": \"Individual\",\n  \"Individual name\": \"Mr. Hassan Phillip Rahaman\",\n  \"Industry type\": \"None\",\n  \"Basic reason for the penalty\": \"Securities Act Violation\",\n  \"Order Type\": \"Settlement\",\n  \"Case Status\": \"Final Hearing\",\n  \"Imposed Penalty\": \"None\",\n  \"Settled Value\": \"Not specified\",\n  \"Currency Code\": \"None\",\n  \"Third Party\": \"None\",\n  \"Summary\": \"The Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission conducted an investigation into Mr. Hassan Phillip Rahaman's application for and purchase of First Citizens Bank Limited Shares (FCB Shares) and subsequent sale.
