The value of the aforesaid products was\\ndetermined in accordance with the underlying basket of instruments. The content of the\\nunderlying basket was determined by the \\u201cindex sponsor\\u201d. According to the terms and\\nconditions governed the specific products the underlying basket was (theoretically) virtual\\nand therefore no actual investment into the underlying was supposed to take place.\\nMarfin Egnatia Bank S.A (a subsidiary of CPB) was initially appointed as the index sponsor.\\nHowever, as a consequence of the results of the cross-border merger between Marfin\\nEgnatia Bank S.A. and the CPB, the CPB became the index sponsor as of 31 March 2011.\\nThe initial investment into the structured products took place on 5 February 2008.\\nHowever, the composition of the underlying basket was dynamic and was determined by\\nthe Index Sponsor. The underlying basket was mainly comprised of shares of the CPB and\\nother firms of the Marfin Investment Group (to which the CPB belonged). The CPB shares\\nwere incorporated into the underlying basket of the Structured Product with ISIN\\nXS0345364227, in 2011.\\nBased on the evidence made available to CySEC, Commerzbank AG executed the voting\\nrights attached to the shares purchased (including the CPB shares) during the\\nShareholders\\u2019 General Meetings in all cases following a request and based on the\\ninstructions of the Index Sponsor. The proxy persons had a direct relationship with the\\nrelevant entities.\\nThe findings of the investigation were that the CPB and Commerzbank AG used the\\nstructured product with ISIN XS0345364227 as a vehicle in order for Commerzbank AG to\\n2\\nact as a surrogate of CPB in a disguised manner and acting in concert to manipulate the\\nmarket in relation to CPB\\u2019s shares on 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26 and 27 April 2011\\nand 6 and 30 May 2011.\\nThe acquisition of CPB shares took place in a way that ensured the share price fixing at\\ncertain levels in accordance with their daily target. The placing of orders was likely to give\\nmisleading signals in relation to CPB shares, as such orders did not correspond to\\ninvestors\\u2019 interest but to fictitious demand that was covertly created by the issuer of the\\nshares. These transactions undertaken by Commerzbank AG as a surrogate for the CPB\\ncorresponded in many cases to a significant proportion of the total daily volume of\\ntransactions in relation to the CPB shares.\\nCySEC decided to impose a cumulative fine of \\u20ac650.000 to Commerzbank AG in\\nrelation to the aforesaid violations (\\u20ac50.000 for every day of being in violation,\\nthirteen days in total), taking the fact that more than eight years have elapsed since\\nthe time of the violation into consideration as a mitigating factor.\\nIn the case of the CPB, CySEC decided not to impose a fine for the aforesaid violation\\ntaking into account that:\\ni.\\nThe CPB is under resolution pursuant to Law 17(I)/2013 and/or pursuant to\\nthe relevant decrees issued by the Central Bank of Cyprus and is under\\nspecial administration since 2013. The main activity of CPB is the execution of\\nthe resolution measures.\\nii.\\nUnder these special circumstances the imposition of a fine to the CPB would\\nfurther burden the financial position of its depositors, bond holders and\\nshareholders.\\nCySEC would like to express its thanks to the \\u039dational Competent Authority of Germany\\n(Bundesanstalt f\\xfcr Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht - BaFin), the Hellenic Capital Market\\nCommission and the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom \\u2013 FCA for the\\nvaluable assistance they provided during this investigation.\\nMore details/justification of CySEC\\u2019s decision are/is available in the Greek version of the\\nannouncement.\\nXB/",

        "Article": "Credit Suisse Equities (Australia) Limited (Credit Suisse) has paid a penalty of $75,000 to comply with an infringement notice given by the Markets\\xa0Disciplinary Panel (the MDP).\\nThe MDP had reasonable grounds to believe that Credit Suisse contravened Rule 3.3.1(b) of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (ASX Market) 2010 (ASX Rules) by failing to act in accordance with its clients\\u2019 instructions. The ASX Rules were superseded by the ASIC\\xa0Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 on 7 May 2018.\\nCredit Suisse was engaged as a broker to conduct an on-market buy-back of shares on behalf of three clients. The MDP was satisfied that from 6 March 2017 to 8 November 2018, Credit Suisse entered into a number of trades by matching orders on behalf of both its buying and selling clients rather than by the matching of orders on an order book. Credit Suisse reported these trades to the ASX as \\u2018Trades with Price Improvement\\u2019 (NXXT Trades).\\nASIC Regulatory Guide 223 Guidance on ASIC market integrity rules for competition in exchange markets (RG 223) and the superseding ASIC Regulatory Guide 265 Guidance on ASIC market integrity rules for participants of securities markets (RG 265) states that an NXXT Trade is not in the ordinary course of trading and is not a transaction permitted for an on-market buy-back. The MDP regards the guidance in RG 223 and RG 265 to correctly reflect the law and prevailing market practice. The MDP considered that Credit Suisse had failed to act in accordance with its clients\\u2019 instructions to conduct an on-market buy-back when it had entered the NXXT trades.\\nThe MDP considered Credit Suisse\\u2019s conduct to be careless because its execution desk employees were inadequately trained in relation to on-market buy-backs and were therefore unaware that NXXT Trades were not permitted during an on-market buy-back. Additionally, Credit Suisse\\u2019s surveillance systems had also failed to prevent the NXXT Trades from being executed.\\nThe MDP considers that all shareholders should be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the buy-back of shares during an on-market buy-back. Market participants should be guided by this in the configuration of their trading systems when they conduct an on-market buy-back of shares on behalf of a listed company.\\nCredit Suisse reported the NXXT Trades to ASIC and took remedial measures by contacting its clients about the NXXT Trades, conducting further training for its execution desk employees, updating the reminder emails sent to execution desk employees not to execute NXXT Trades during an on-market buy-back, and implementing further processes to review certain trades (including NXXT Trades).\\xa0\\nThe MDP was satisfied that Credit Suisse did not appear to derive any benefit from the conduct beyond the brokerage fees and commissions, and that the conduct did not cause financial loss to its clients or third parties.\\nDownload the infringement notice\\nThe compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability, and Credit Suisse is not\\xa0taken to have contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act.",

According to information gathered by the CMF's Investigation Unit, the firm known as \"Credifinanzas\" offers quick loans on supposedly advantageous terms through its website. The offer involves expeditious granting of a loan at a convenient interest rate and with no requirements of financial records.\\\\nModus Operandi\\\\nAs detailed in the CMF's complaint, Credifinanzas uses its website to attract people in need of a loan. After applying, they would be contacted by email, phone or WhatsApp. Then, using official-looking documentation, such as logos of the former Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions (ex-SBIF), Credifinanzas requested an advance payment of money based on inaccurate grounds, such as insurance and loan-related fees. In cases where customers did transfer the money, they received neither the committed loan nor a refund of the amounts disbursed.\\\\nConsidering both the facts described and that Credifinanzas is not supervised by the Commission, the Board of the CMF decided to file fraud charges according to Article 468 of the Criminal Code.\\\\nInvestor Alerts\\\\nThe Financial Market Commission also informs that is has an Alert Portal for investors, policyholders, and banking customers on its website.

        "Title": "CMF files charges against four firms who offer loans on their websites for alleged fraud",
        "Article": "The firms are Multibankacl, Cooperativa Financiera Latinoamericana, Finanzas Futuras, and Multinvercr\\\\xe9ditos.\\\\nThese companies claimed to be supervised by the Commission, collecting advance payments from people who applied for a loan and did not receive the agreed funds.\\\\nThe CMF has also launched a new Alert Portal for investors, policyholders, and banking customers.\\\\nApril 20, 2020.- On April 17, 2020 the Financial Market Commission (CMF) filed a complaint against any responsible parties before the Public Prosecutor's Office for alleged fraud. The firms mentioned in the complaint are Multibankacl, Cooperativa Financiera Latinoamericana, Finanzas Futuras, and Multinvercr\\\\xe9ditos.\\\\nAccording to information gathered by the CMF's Investigation Unit, these four firms collected advance payments from people who applied for a loan and did not receive the agreed funds. Said entities, which claimed to be supervised by the Commission, neither have such status nor are registered in its registers.\\\\nModus Operandi\\\\nAs the complaint details, these firms used their websites to target people in need of loans. Then, using official-looking information such as logos of the former Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF, for its Spanish acronym), customers are offered a loan by requesting an advance money transfer. This requirement is based on false information, such as insurance fees associated to the loan. In cases where customers did transfer the money, they received neither the committed loan nor a refund of the amounts disbursed.\\\\nConsidering both the facts described and that the aforementioned entities are not supervised by the Commission, the Board of the CMF decided to file fraud charges according to Article 468 of the Criminal Code.\\\\nInvestor Alerts\\\\nThe Financial Market Commission also informs that is has launched an Alert Portal for investors, policyholders, and banking customers on its website. On this portal you can:\\\\nAccess the complete roll of all individuals and legal entities under the CMF's supervision.\\\\nVerify whether a company or individual offering financial products or services is supervised by the Commission.\\\\nCheck alerts issued by the CMF and other foreign regulators on unregulated entities or activities.\\\\nAccess important advice to safeguard investors, policyholders, and financial clients.\\\\nThe CMF always recommends checking the information available on anyone offering financial products and services.",
