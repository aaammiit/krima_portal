        "Article": "25 Feb 2020, 09:02 am\\nDFSA Fines Company USD 105,000 for Unauthorised Activity\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEnness Limited acted outside the limits of its DIFC Representative Office Licence\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) today announced that it has fined Enness Limited (Enness DIFC), a DIFC Representative Office. The DFSA fined Enness DIFC USD 105,000 (approximately AED 386,000) for engaging in unauthorised activity outside the scope of its Representative Office DFSA Licence.\\n\\nAs a Representative Office, Enness DIFC is only permitted to carry out a narrow set of activities in the DIFC relating to the marketing of mortgage services offered by its head office based in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nThe DFSA\\u2019s investigation found that between November 2017 and January 2019, Enness DIFC arranged mortgages for its clients, and provided mortgage advice for its clients. Enness DIFC was not authorised to engage in such activity, and in doing so acted outside the scope of its Representative Office Licence, in breach of the DFSA\\u2019s laws.\\n\\nEnness DIFC fully cooperated with the DFSA's investigation, and has sought to obtain an appropriate DFSA Licence authorising it to carry on the wider Financial Service of Arranging Credit and Advising on Credit.\\n\\nFurthermore, Enness DIFC also agreed to settle the DFSA's action at an early stage of the investigation and, therefore, qualified for a discount under the DFSA's policy for early settlement.\\xa0 Were it not for the settlement discount, the DFSA would have imposed a fine of USD 150,000 (approximately AED 551,000) on Enness DIFC.\\n\\nMr Bryan Stirewalt, Chief Executive of the DFSA, said: \\u201cThis action demonstrates that the DFSA takes the failure by Representative Offices to act within the scope of their Licences seriously. We expect that all Representative Offices in the DIFC understand what they are authorised to do, and have controls in place that ensure they only engage in authorised activities. \\u201d\\n\\nThe detailed reasons for the DFSA\\u2019s action against Enness DIFC are set out in the DFSA\\u2019s Decision Notice dated 24th February 2020, which can be found in the Regulatory Actions section of the DFSA website.",

To this end the Commission sought\\\\nexternal legal advice.\\\\n5.\\\\nThe Commission, after considering the legal advice received, commenced administrative\\\\nproceedings by Notices of Hearing dated 20th July 2018 and supplemented by Notices of\\\\nHearing dated 17th September 2018, 5th October 2018 and 25th January 2019.\\\\n6.\\\\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Commission\\\\u2019s Securities Industry (Hearings\\\\nand Settlements) Practice Rules 2008, the first private pre- hearing conference into the\\\\nMatter took place on 30th January 2019, followed by a second one on 22nd July2019.\\\\n7.\\\\nAfter the Commission\\\\u2019s administrative proceedings commenced, the Respondents\\\\nindividually approached the Commission with requests to enter into settlement\\\\ndiscussions.\\\\n8.\\\\nThe Commission eventually settled with all four respondents namely, Hassan Phillip\\\\nRahaman, Imtiaz Rahaman, Subhas Ramkhelawan and Bourse Brokers Limited by three\\\\nseparate settlement agreements each dated 20th December 2019.\\\\n9.\\\\nThe Settlement Agreements were approved by the Board of Commissioners by Orders\\\\ndated 29th January 2020.\\\\n10.\\\\nThe full texts of the Settlement Agreements and the Orders are available on the\\\\nCommission\\\\u2019s website and members of the public are encouraged to read the\\\\ndocuments in their entirety. The links to the documents on the Commission\\\\u2019s  website\\\\nare as follows:\\\\nSettlement Orders - https://www.ttsec.org.tt/legal-framework/?_sft_category=orders\\\\nSettlement Agreements - https://www.ttsec.org.tt/legal-framework/decisionssettlements/\\\\nResponse to the Public Commentary:\\\\n1. It is therefore incorrect to infer that the Commission acted without consulting the DPP\\\\nor considering whether any criminal offences had been committed by the Respondents.\\\\nThe Commission took all reasonable steps in exploring whether the Respondents\\\\u2019\\\\nactions amounted to criminal offences.2. The Commission initiated administrative proceedings after the DPP concluded that there\\\\nwas insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. In March 2017 the Minister of\\\\nFinance reported to Parliament on the Commission\\\\u2019s referral of this Matter to the DPP\\\\nas a matter of public record.\\\\n3. The settlement of matters with respect to breaches of securities legislation is a common\\\\ninstance of international best practice, as it is an efficient means of regulating securities\\\\nmarkets. In the year 2019, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\\\\nsettled 23% of the Matters that it opened; the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK\\\\nsettled 55% of the matters opened and the Australian Securities and Investment\\\\nCommission (ASIC) settled 84% of the matters opened.\\\\n4. In most instances, settlement negotiations and agreements take place in circumstances\\\\nwhere eventual legal outcomes are uncertain and/or the resolution process is expected\\\\nto be both lengthy and costly. Settlement allows the regulator control and certainty\\\\nover the outcome and saves the time and resources that would otherwise be expended\\\\nin lengthy proceedings, including appeals to the High Court, Court of Appeal or Privy\\\\nCouncil pursuant to Section 161 of the Securities Act.\\\\n5. The Commission\\\\u2019s ability to impose fines in administrative proceedings is capped at TTD\\\\n$500,000 per contravention as prescribed by Section 156 (1) of the Securities Act.\\\\nFurther the Commission does not have the statutory authority to make an order of\\\\ndisgorgement nor does it have the ability to Order that shares be forfeited.\\\\n6. The Settlements were guided primarily by the public interest which requires the\\\\nCommission to consider, among other factors, the seriousness and nature of the alleged\\\\ncontraventions, the need for a resolution of the Matter which began six years ago, as\\\\nwell as the uncertainty of the outcome of a lengthy and contested hearing.\\\\n7. Further the Commission determined that the Settlements were consistent with its\\\\ninternal policy, which provides that for contraventions where there is no evidence of\\\\nactual harm to investors, settlement amounts of a particular range (below the maximum\\\\namount of TTD 500, 000) should be levied. Actual harm to investors would typically arise\\\\nwhere investors provide proof of financial loss as a result of the contravention.\\\\n8. In conclusion, the Commission acted consistent with the public interest, reasonably and\\\\nproportionately within the parameters of its statutory powers in considering criminal\\\\nliability and in pursuing administrative action against the Respondents.\\\\nDated the 21st day of February 2020\\\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER",
