It represents the culmination of the regulatory process and outlines the legally binding requirements or standards that entities or individuals must adhere to within the jurisdiction governed by the regulatory body. Once a Final Rule is issued, it typically becomes enforceable law, subject to compliance and enforcement mechanisms established by the regulatory authority.\n\nConsultation: Consultation refers to the process by which regulatory agencies or governmental bodies seek input, feedback, and expertise from stakeholders, including industry representatives, affected parties, advocacy groups, and the general public, during the formulation or modification of regulations. This process is essential for ensuring transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in regulatory actions. Consultation may involve various methods such as public hearings, stakeholder meetings, written submissions, expert panels, or online forums, with the aim of soliciting diverse perspectives and gathering relevant information to inform regulatory decision-making. Effective consultation fosters collaboration, consensus-building, and the development of regulations that reflect the needs and interests of stakeholders while achieving regulatory objectives.\n\nProposed Rule: A Proposed Rule, also known as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) or similar terms in different jurisdictions, is a formal document issued by a regulatory agency or governing body to announce and solicit public feedback on a proposed regulatory change or amendment before it is finalized and implemented.

It serves as a means for stakeholders and the public to review, analyze, and provide comments on the proposed regulatory action, including its potential benefits, costs, and implications for affected parties.
